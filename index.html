<h2> ABOUT SECTION</h2>
 <p>My name is <strong>Brian Otieno Lubalo</strong>, I’m 24 years old and born and raised in Western Kenya but currently residing in Nairobi county .
  I started my schooling at a local school called Pan paper primary school from nursery to class four then I proceeded to St Joseph primary school still in Western Kenya where I did my class eight. From there I went to St Mathews secondary school Webuye where I studied from form one to form four. I joined the Kisumu national polytechnic where I’m taking Diploma in information technology.Reason for enrolling to Moringa school is because of the passion I do have in programing and I want to learn about the technology  which is changing at a very fast rate.</p>
  <p>My hobbies and interest include; <strong>listening to music,watching basketball,playing basketball and just going out to walk</strong></p>
